The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. Since tweets are unstructured data, we will need to apply Natural Language Processing techniques to parse information out of free texts.

The data was sourced from Kaggle as part of an NLP competition.

The folder includes both Project Report and codebase.

Project Report summarizes the process of analyzing unstructured data and applying sophisticated NLP techniques such as token vectorization, word embeddings and deep learning algorithms, to predict whether a tweet denotes a real disaster event.
