The goal of this project is to predict whether a user will churn after his/her subscription expires. The binary classification models built to achieve the objective are trained and tested on sample data sourced from Kaggle. 
The data was uploaded/provided on Kaggle by the firm KKBOX for the WSDM 2018 challenge.

The folder includes both Project Report and codebase.

Project Report summarizes the process of data analysis in the B2C context, application of domain knowledge for superior feature engineering and development of advanced machine learning algorithms to predict churn of subscription users for KKBOX music streaming service.
